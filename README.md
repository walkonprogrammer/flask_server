# Warning: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production development.
# *Use a production WSGI server instead!


# set up a web server and create a simple website using Flask, Python, and HTML/CSS
# The web server will be able to react to the dynamic content that the user inputs, so your website will be a web application that can more than just show static information
# requirements: Python 3, install Python modules using pip

# First, set up a basic web application with Flask and Python
# Download and install Python 3, pip, and the Flask package
# create a directory for the web application 
# create page(s) for the web application

# the HTML web page will be created from a template that holds the static content of the page
# create a directory for the template HTML page(s)
# create a new file index.html in the templates folder
# modify existing routes to return a full HTML web page
# insert data to create a dynamic version of the page

# add CSS to the web page(s)
# create a directotory for the CSS page(s)
# create a new file style.css in the static folder
# insert CSS rules to the file

# modify HTML template index.html to include the CSS rules
